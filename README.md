# Boilerframe

Basic web site boilerplate/framework for quicker frontend workflow. The goal is to have a tool that makes repeating patterns configurable with SASS and as little bloat as possible.

## Typography

Typography is based on SASS map variables with settings:
- family
- weight
- size
- height
- spacing
- caps
- shift (baseline)

and can be set with set-type() mixin.
